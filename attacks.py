                  probabilities, i.e., the output of the softmax)
    :param loss: the model loss
    :param y: (optional) A placeholder for the model labels. If targeted
              is true, then provide the target label. Otherwise, only provide
              this parameter if you'd like to use true labels when crafting
              adversarial samples. Otherwise, model predictions are used as
              labels to avoid the "label leaking" effect (explained in this
              paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01236). Default is None.
              Labels should be one-hot-encoded.
    :param eps: the epsilon (input variation parameter)
    :param ord: (optional) Order of the norm (mimics NumPy).
                Possible values: np.inf, 1 or 2.
    :param clip_min: Minimum float value for adversarial example components
    :param clip_max: Maximum float value for adversarial example components
    :param targeted: Is the attack targeted or untargeted? Untargeted, the
                     default, will try to make the label incorrect. Targeted
                     will instead try to move in the direction of being more
                     like y.
